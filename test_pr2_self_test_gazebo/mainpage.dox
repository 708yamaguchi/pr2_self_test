\b test_pr2_self_test_gazebo runs regression tests on certain subtests of the PR2 Self Test system in gazebo. It is used for full regression testing of the self test sytem. 

The PR2 Self Test system runs tests on PR2 components and full PR2 robots. Each test has a series of subtest. For example, the wrist component test performs a hysteresis analysis on the flex and roll joints, and performs a "wrist difference check" to compare the two motors. These subtests can launch controllers on the robot, and perform analysis on robot data. Using gazebo, this package can run these safely in simulation as a regression test.

The tests currently in the package are run during build tests (ex: "make test"). The tests use specified launch files found in the qualification package to run the qualification subtest. The subtests are launched with gazebo, and an "check" node that makes sure the test gave the expected result.
