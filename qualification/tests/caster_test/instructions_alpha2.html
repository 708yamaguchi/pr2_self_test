<H3>Verifying Correct Caster Type</H3>
<p>This will only work with Alpha 2.0 casters. Make sure your caster looks like the one in the picture above. If it has plate sheet metal on the sides around the wheels, it is the correct caster. To qualify an Alpha 1.0 caster, go back and select 'Caster Alpha 1.0' from the menu after you scan the part.</p>
<p><b>Do not proceed if you are not sure.</b></p>
<p>If your caster spins extremely quickly during calibration and hysteresis, it is probably an Alpha 1.0 caster. You must fail the component if this happens, and retry the test as an Alpha 1.0 caster.</p>
<H3>Checking Caster Front/Back</H3>
<p>The front of the caster is the side with the continuous sheet metal front (the side with the barcode in the picture). From this, you should be able to identify the left and right wheels. Make sure the correct wheel is turning during left/right hysteresis tests.</p>
<H3>Connecting the Caster</H3>
<p>Connect the caster to the test cart's power cable using the attached female power cable. Connect the EtherCAT to the test cart connection using the M-to-M RJ-45 adapter.</p>
<p><b>Press 'Continue' to start qualification.</b></p>
