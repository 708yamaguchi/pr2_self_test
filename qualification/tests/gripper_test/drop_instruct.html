<H2>Gripper Drop Test</H2>
<H3>Connecting the Gripper</H3>
<p>If you have just finished the "Gripper Test" and haven't unplugged the gripper, you are already connected.</p>
<p>Make sure the gripper is fully secured in the gripper test fixture. Plug the cable from the test fixture into the small plug on the gripper board, through the back of the gripper. Plug the power and etherCAT cables from the qualification computer in to the gripper test fixture.</p>
<p>Double check that the computer and the power breaker for your cables. Set the correct computer (test host) and breakers in the menu. <b>Do not proceed without setting the correct computer and breaker.</b></p>
<H3>Dropping the Gripper</H3>
<p>Drop the gripper according to the instructions when prompted. Click "Continue" after every drop. The computer will fail the test automatically if it loses packets from the gripper, or the gripper loses power.</p>
<p>After dropping the gripper, you'll be prompted to visually inspect it. If you see any scratches, dents or marks, press "Cancel" to fail the gripper.</p>
<p><b>Press 'Continue' to proceed.</b></p>
