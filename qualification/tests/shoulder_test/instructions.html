You are testing the shoulder:<br>

Make sure that the power and ethernet cables are attached.
<br>
Place bubble wrap above the shoulder counterbalance to prevent damage to the mechanism. Move the counterbalance attachment out of the way of the shoulder life.
<br>
Secure the top of the shoulder down to ensure that the calibration flag trips the optical sensor. Do this with either a 20# weight on top, or screws if available.
