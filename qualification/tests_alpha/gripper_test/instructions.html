<p>Plug the gripper cable from the test cart in to the gripper MCB. Move the cable through the round gripper mount hole in the back of the gripper. Do not put the cable through the open access port on the outside of the gripper.</p>
<H3>Testing Procedures</H3>
<p>Hold the gripper by the gripper mount during tests. Do not interfere with the gripper when it is calibrating, as it may cause the gripper to set its zero position early.</p>
