<H2>Alpha 1.0 Head</H2>
<H3>This does not test the laser tilt or hokuyo</H3>
<br>
<H3>Verifying Head Type</H3>
<p><b>Small throat, small motor, small gearhead.</b></p>
<p>The Alpha 1.0 head can be identified as the head with the smaller "throat" and limited tilt range. If your head can tilt forward almost 80 degrees, it is an Alpha 2.0 head.</p>
<p>Check the motor size on the tilt. It should be a 310009 Maxon motor with a 23:1 gear reduction. If you see a 148887 motor, you are testing an Alpha 2.0b head.</p>
<p><b>Do not proceed if you are not sure.</b></p>
<H3>Connecting the Head</H3>
<p>Follow these instructions carefully. If your laser tilt MCB is plugged in or your tilt motor is unpowered, this test will not work.</p>
<p>Plug your etherCAT cable directly in to the head pan MCB. This is located inside the "doghouse" on the back right side. The laser tilt MCB may be plugged in that port, unplug that if necessary. Plug the power cable from the cart into the head pan MCB.</p>
<p>Connect the power cable to the head tilt MCB to the test cart. The power cable is inside a black cable coming directly from the head tilt. At the end of the black cable, you should see two power connectors. The smaller black one will connect to your female power cable to your test cart. Trace the cable path from the tilt MCB to the test cart power board to verify.</p>
<p>This test will not work if the laser tilt MCB is plugged in. To test the laser tilt, press "Cancel", and scan the barcode on the side of the laser tilt. If the computer detects 3 MCB's instead of 2, you may have left the laser tilt MCB plugged in.</p>
